Explanation and Comment on the Results üöÄ
The Actual vs Predicted graph illustrates the relationship between the actual 
number of rings (Actual) and the predicted number of rings (Predicted) produced by the model. 


‚≠ê Observations:
The points on the graph are well-aligned with the diagonal, showing that the model captures the relationship
between the input features and the target variable effectively.
Most predictions for actual ring counts between 5 and 15 are close to their actual values, which indicates 
good model performance in this range.
The graph demonstrates the model‚Äôs ability to generalize well across the dataset,
with most predictions closely following the ideal trend.
‚≠ê Strengths:
The clustering of points near the diagonal reflects the model's high accuracy for the majority of the dataset.
The visualized results highlight the reliability of the predictions for a broad range of actual values.
‚≠ê Conclusion:
The graph confirms that the model performs well in predicting the
number of rings, aligning closely with the actual values for most observations. 
This outcome validates the model's effectiveness and its ability to generalize on unseen data.
